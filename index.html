             teaches students 
            entirely or primarily online or through the Internet. It has been defined as "education that
             uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the 
             instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students.
             Online education exists all around the world and is used for all levels of
              education.
               This type of learning enables the individuals to earn transferable credits, 
               take recognized examinations, or advance to the next level of education over the Internet.</p>

        <p class="section-SubTag textS">Online tutoring is the process of tutoring in an online, virtual,
             or networked, environment, in which teachers and learners participate from separate physical
              locations. Aside from space, literature also states that participants can be separated by
               time.

            Online tutoring is practiced using many different approaches for 
            distinct sets of users. The distinctions are in content and user interface,
             as well as in tutoring styles and tutor-training methodologies.
              Definitions associated with online tutoring vary widely, reflecting the
               ongoing evolution of the technology, the refinement and variation in online 
               learning methodology, and the interactions of the organizations that deliver online 
               tutoring services with the institutions, individuals, and learners that employ the services.

        <p class="section-SubTag textS">Creative education is when students are able to use imagination
             and critical thinking
             to create new and meaningful forms of ideas where they can take risks,
              be independent and flexible. Instead of being taught to reiterate what was learned, 
              students learn to develop their ability to find various solutions to a problem.
               Coming up with various out-of-the box solutions is known as divergent thinking 
               and there is no one way of cultivating this skill - largely due to the newness 
               of the concept and the limited scientific information on creativity.</p>
